# drupal-purger
This module allows Section’s global, distributed caching layer to quickly
respond to invalidation events from a Drupal instance in exactly the same way
that Drupal’s internal cache or a local varnish cache running on the host
machine does, ensuring that the content in Section’s global caching layer is
always up to date.

## Installation

## Development

Notes on Architecture:

- Assuming you have the purge module installed, navigate to the Purger's UI at
`/admin/config/development/performance/purge`
- This module depends on the key module to store your password for aperture.
Make sure your password is correct because the purger will send hundreds of
requests to the API which could potentially lock out your account if the
authentication attempts fail.
- Drupal will queue bans with the Core tags queuer, but make sure you have a
processor installed (cron, or LateRuntimeProcessor)
- The bundled purger will combine tag purges into one request per every 250 tag
invalidations in the queue. Bundled URL purging is not supported but we are open
to feedback – after consulting with the back-end team, the opinion is that this
would be too resource intensive.
- Tags are hashed to preserve privacy. If varnish caches a page while logged in,
you will need to clear the cache. Consider updating your VCL to not cache
requests that have either tags specific to authentication, or a session cookie.
More info on this in the installation instructions linked above.
- There are many other invalidation types that you can use with other processors
and queuers. See the table below.
- The actual purger functions are performed by code inside
`src/Plugin/Purge/Purger/SectionPurgerBase` as well as the two child classes of
it: `SectionPurger` and `SectionBundledPurger`.
- The configuration form is controlled by code in `src/Form`. Data input via
this form is stored in `/src/Entity/SectionPurgerSettings.php`. If you want to
create a hardcoded variable value that is not customer facing, simply include
this variable in this file and make no reference to it in the form.
If you'd like a default value that is subsequently adjustable by the user, add
that variable with the default value to `SectionPurgerSettings.php` and add its
field to the user input form. There are examples of both of these in the
existing codebase. Note that in order for a variable to be overwritten by the
form input, it needs to be enumerated in the `section_purger.schema.yml`
- This module was developed as a fork of the generic http purger. Any questions
on the development history can be answered by comparing the current state to
that project — the git history is rather mangled due to moving between repos.
- The generic HTTP purger also contained code for a Bundled Purger (which lived
in the Purger directory alongside the Section Purgers). The functionality of
this has not been comprehensively understood, but in the abstract it coalesces
multiple ban requests into a single API call. Because the choke point for this
operation was believed to be Varnish Cache's ability to process bans rather than
the API's ability to accept requests, this mode was determined to be unnecessary
at the time. If this functionality is desired, the relevant code (it was not
adapted for Section in any way before deletion) can be recovered from version
control or from the source HTTP Purger.
- The plugin currently supports an optional sitename feature designed to
support Drupal multisites. If no sitename is specified, then the plugin clears
cache for any pages with the relevant cache tags. If the sitename is filled in,
the plugin appends a check for the specified hostname. Each Drupal site within
a multisite has its own admin dashboard and its own UI in which to enable the
purger.
- The plugin is able to handle alternate varnish proxy names (as written in your
section config). Usually the name for the proxy is 'varnish' but some
configurations have multiple instances of varnish running for different tasks.
Note that if using multiple varnish instances, you will have to enable another
purger in order to handle multiple instances of varnish. If using multi-site
as well as multiple varnish proxies, you will need a purger instance per-varnish
instance per-site.
- If you wish to uninstall the Plugin from a live site for the purposes of
testing, the most efficient way to do so is to uninstall the plugin from the
admin console. Once it has been uninstalled there, you can delete it from the
filesystem of the live box (Drupal may overwrite old files of the same name if
you try and upload the same module again — this has not been proven). Deleting
the module from the filesystem while it is still installed will cause a total
failure of the site. The only known fix for this is a reinstall of Drupal as a
whole, although there are likely easier ways to fix it.


| Invalidation Type | Description                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| domain            | Invalidates an entire domain name. e.g.: example.com                                                                                                   |
| everything        | Invalidates Everything. No argument required.                                                                                                          |
| tag               | Invalidates by Drupal cache tag, e.g.: menu:footer                                                                                                     |
| url               | Invalidates by URL, e.g. http://site.com/node/1  (***NOTE:** this, by nature, does not use the sitename configured in the purger, but rather whatever url fed to this type will be purged from varnish. Also, the protocol is specific; for example if invalidating an http request, the https equivalent will not be invalidated*)                |
| wildcardurl       | Invalidates by URL, e.g. http://site.com/node/*  (see note above)                                                                                                      |
| path              | Invalidates by path, e.g. news/article-1. This should not start with a slash, and should not contain the hostname.                                     |
| wildcardpath      | Invalidates by path, e.g. news/*                                                                                                                       |
| regex             | this will insert any string into a varnish ban expression of `req.url ~ "input"`. Will also insert a domain check if multi-site is in use. |
| raw               | this allows for any varnish ban expression to be input. Useful with drush, and perhaps cronjobs e.g. obj.status == 404 && req.url ~ node\/(?).*.  |
